South Jordan - Thursday at 10:58pm - 33 degrees and cloudy.
It snowed when I was driving to school today.
The roads were very slick.
I hit some black ice when everyone had stopped.
I had to pull off to the side of the freeway so I wouldn't hit anyone.
After that the snow got really thick and was coming down fast.
Everyone drove at 0-1 mph for 20 minutes.
