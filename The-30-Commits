South Jordan - Thursday at 10:58pm - 33 degrees and cloudy.
It snowed when I was driving to school today.
The roads were very slick.
I hit some black ice when everyone had stopped.
I had to pull off to the side of the freeway so I wouldn't hit anyone.
After that the snow got really thick and was coming down fast.
Everyone drove at 0-1 mph for 20 minutes.
Stupid snow.
It made me late for class.
South Jordan - Thursday at 11:09pm - 33 degrees and cloudy.
The weather app says the low was supposed to be 25 degrees today.
But there are only 40 minutes left in the day.
And it's still 33 degrees.
Of course the weather app has been wrong for the past few days.
It told me it would be raining and snowing yesterday.
But it didn't rain or snow.
We actually had some nice weather yesterday.
You want to know when it's actually going to be 25 degrees?
Of course you want to know. I'll tell you.
It's supposed to be 25 degrees tomorrow at 7AM.
Oh and it will be cloudy. We can't forget that.
Want to know something else about tomorrow?
Once the sun comes up, it is supposed to be partly cloudy all day.
And the high for tomorrow?
31 degrees.
That is so cold. And in Orem it is supposed to be 36 degrees.
And cloudy. Can't forget that it will be partially cloudy there too.
Al Fox Carraway is speaking at the Orem Institute at 12 tomorrow.
So at least there's that one good thing about tomorrow.
It's not that I don't like the cold weather. I just don't like all the icy slush everywhere.
Do you know how many times I've almost fallen from slipping on the ice this week?
Nine times. NINE.
And I only come to school on Tuesday and Thursday. I don't even go outside that much.
